#+title: Tiqle

* Tiqle a really tiny pubsub implementation.
** Status:  Just vague ideas
  - Consider hooking into objects directly...?
  - subscribe functions receive an event-type object rather than arguments directly. 

** Spec
   
   - It should accept multiple subscriptions and run them in order
   - it should not mess around with "this" binding at all.
   - It should have proper specs around bind
